title: Becoming a Scala OSS Contributor
---
You are a confident Scala programmer who is looking to give back to the community. Or maybe you are only at the start of your Scala journey and are looking for good ways to improve your expertise. Regardless of your background, contributing to open source Scala libraries has its own benefits for you.

## Why contribute?
Open Source Software (OSS) libraries are the flesh on top of the bone structure of the core language itself. They power vast majority of the commercial and non-commercial projects out there alike.

Contributing is a great way to strengthen your CV. It's also good from the community standpoint: if you do it consistently, with time, you get to know people, and people get to know you. Such a networking can lead to all sorts of opportunities.

Contributing to open source libraries is a great way to learn Scala. A standard practice in open source software is code review – which means you are going to get expert feedback about your code. Learning together with feedback from competent people is much faster than making all the mistakes and figuring them out alone.

Finally, by contributing you improve the projects you are using yourself. Being a part of a maintainer team can be a source of personal satisfaction, and working on an innovative library can be a lot of fun.

The above benefits are something good to achieve regardless of your level of experience.

## Ways to contribute
Often, when people are talking about contributing to OSS, they think of fixing issues or implementing new features. While a valuable help, these are far from the only ways you can contribute. Following are some other ways you should consider:

- **Documentation**. Often it is outdated, incomplete, erroneous. If you see a way to improve a documentation for a project you are using, you should consider finding out if the the documentation is hosted on github in which case you can submit a pull request to fix it.
- **Issue minimization**. Many of the reported issues found on a project's issue tracker are hard to reproduce and the reproduction involves a lot of code. However, it is very frequently the case that only a tiny fraction of the reported setup and code is necessary to reproduce the issue. More reproduction code means more work for the maintainer to fix an issue. You can help them considerably by investigating already reported issues in an attempt to make their reproduction as small as possible.
- **Issue reproduction**. Some reported issues lack reproduction instructions at all! If a maintainer can't reproduce it, they won't be able to fix it. Pinning down exact conditions that make an issue manifest is another way to contribute.
- **Open-source your own project**. Do you have a pet project you are working on? Is there anything you're working on at work parts of which are generic enough that you can share them online? Open-sourcing your work is a way to solve a problem for other programmers who may also have it. If you are interested in going open-source, here is an excellent guide on how to get started: [https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/contributors/index.html](https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/contributors/index.html).

## What should I contribute to?
The best project to contribute to is the one that you are using yourself. Take an inventory of your work and hobby projects: what OSS libraries do they use? Have you ever encountered bugs in them? Or have you ever wanted a certain feature implemented? Pick a bug and a feature and commit to fixing or implementing it. Clone the project you are trying to improve, figure out how the tests are written and run there. Write a test for your feature or bug.

While implementing or fixing the feature, it is important to ask for help early when you feel stuck. Even if your code doesn't work, don't hesitate to submit a pull request while stating clearly that you need help. More information about the guidelines of good contribution you can find in the [talk by Seth Tisue](https://youtu.be/DTUpSTrnI-0) on how to be a good contributor.

If you can't immediately see a bug or feature that you personally would like to use, a good idea is to learn a new Scala library, push it to its limits and see where it can be improved. You can find popular Scala libraries on [Scaladex](https://index.scala-lang.org/awesome). It's not a good idea to just pick a random library from the list and try fixing random bugs in it: you need to really spend the time with it to start seeing what's important and how to improve it right. So if you are passionate about contributing but don't see any immediate contribution options that would attract you, this should be your cue that it is time to expand your horizons and learn something new.

There is also an option to contribute to the Scala 3 compiler itself. The Scala Center runs the Compiler Academy project to onboard and educate new people in the Scala 3 compiler. One of the Compiler Academy projects is an Issue Spree – an event that takes place every 3 weeks where people fix Scala 3 compiler issues in pair programming sessions while learning the compiler together. You can apply for the Spree participation by [filling the form](https://forms.gle/DfoSuHFm3T6MA3L59).

You may want to keep an eye on the Scala Center [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/scala-center/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/scala_lang) to stay up-to-date with the possible contribution opportunities. For example, every year, the Scala Center participates in the Google Summer of Code program where you are paid to work on open source Scala projects over the course of summer.
