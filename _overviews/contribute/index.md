### So You Decided Where to Contribute

There is also an option to contribute to the Scala 3 compiler itself. The Scala Center runs the
Compiler Academy project to onboard and educate new people in the Scala 3 compiler. One of the Compiler Academy
projects is an Issue Spree â€“ an event that takes place every 3 weeks where people fix Scala 3 compiler issues
in pair programming sessions while learning the compiler together. You can apply for the Spree participation
by [filling the form](https://forms.gle/DfoSuHFm3T6MA3L59).
