## Contributing to IDE and Build Tools

The links below are to a number of Scala build and IDE related projects that are important in the larger Scala space, and which welcome contributions.

Since these tools are in separate projects, they may (and likely will) have their own rules and guidelines for contributing. You should also check the `README.md` and (if it's present) `CONTRIBUTING.md` files from the actual projects before contributing to them.

Typically, issues for these projects will be reported and kept in the GitHub project issue tracker for that project rather than in the Scala bug tracker.

Many of these projects have a chat room on Discord or Gitter (usually linked from their `README.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md` files) which is a great place to discuss proposed work before starting.

There are some projects in this section that are in
[particular need](#projects-in-particular-need) so please check those out
if you would like to help revive them.

### Broken Links?
