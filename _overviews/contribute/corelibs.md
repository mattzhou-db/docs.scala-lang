## Core Library Contributions

There are several options for contributing to Scala's core libraries. You can:

* Help with [Documentation][documentation].
* [Report Bugs or Issues][bug-reporting-guide] against the core libraries.
* [Fix Bugs or Issues][guide] against the
  [reported library bugs/issues](https://github.com/scala/bug).

### Significant changes

For significant new functionality or a whole new API to be considered for inclusion in the core Scala distribution,
please take into account [scala/scala-dev#661](https://github.com/scala/scala-dev/issues/661) before doing so.
